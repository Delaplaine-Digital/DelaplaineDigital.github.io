        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This section documents the computer-side of Delaplaine Digital Solutions:
          the Windows 11 Pro box that runs VMs, the NAS stack, routing and firewall
          projects, Pi-hole, and future SOC / malware testing environments.
          Over time each card below can become a full write-up with screenshots,
          configs, and code.
        </p>
        <p class="small-note">
          Related screenshots and diagrams can be stored under
          <code>/assets/computers/</code>.

        <h2>Current & Planned Builds</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>VM-Based NAS & File Server</h3>
            <p>
              A virtualized NAS running on a Windows 11 Pro host, serving as centralized
              storage for photos, projects, and backups. Includes SMB shares, access
              control, and performance tuning work.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Ideas to cover later: disk layout, virtual disks, backup strategy,
              performance issues and fixes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>OPNsense Firewall & Network Segmentation</h3>
            <p>
              A dedicated OPNsense firewall VM / mini PC to separate lab traffic from
              household devices, experiment with rules, VLANs, and logging, and serve
              as the core of a more secure home network.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Potential content: WAN/LAN layout, DD-WRT as a switch, rulesets, logging,
              and lessons learned.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>Pi-hole & DNS Filtering</h3>
            <p>
              A Pi-hole instance handling DNS for the network, blocking ads, trackers,
              and noisy domains. Ties into the firewall for better visibility and
              control of traffic.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Later: screenshots of the dashboard, blocklists used, and how it ties into
              the rest of the lab.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>Homelab & Virtualization Stack</h3>
            <p>
              The main Windows 11 Pro machine runs multiple VMs: NAS, firewall,
              potential SOC tools, and sandboxes. This is the platform for testing,
              learning, and breaking things safely.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Good place to document: hypervisor choice, resource allocation, and
              what each VM is responsible for.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>SOC Sim & Security Lab (Planned)</h3>
            <p>
              A simulated security operations center environment built from open source
              tools, log collection, and alerting pipelines to practice detection,
              investigation, and response workflows.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Future write-up could include: tool stack, sample attack scenarios,
              and how alerts are triaged.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>Malware Testing / Sandbox Environment (Planned)</h3>
            <p>
              A controlled environment for analyzing suspicious files and behavior
              without risking daily-use machines. Will likely use isolated VMs, strict
              network rules, and snapshot-based recovery.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Later sections might show: network isolation diagrams, snapshot strategy,
              and any custom tooling or scripts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-card">
            <h3>Python & Utility Scripts</h3>
            <p>
              Small tools written in Python to scan the local network, gather system
              information, or automate repetitive tasks. These scripts tie together
              different parts of the lab.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              Eventually: code snippets, GitHub links, and usage examples.

        <h2>Next Steps for This Page</h2>
        <p>
          As projects evolve, each item above can be expanded into its own dedicated page
          with more detail. For now, this page works as a map of the computer-side
          infrastructure behind Delaplaine Digital Solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="small-note">
          When you're ready, you can turn each card into a link and create pages like
          <code>nas.html</code>, <code>opnsense.html</code>, or <code>soc-lab.html</code>
          with deeper write-ups.
