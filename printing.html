        <h2>How This Section Is Organized</h2>
        <p>
          This page focuses on 3D-printed parts and, later, small-scale laser-cut projects.
          Each card below represents a part I've designed or printed, with links or space for
          photos and files.
        </p>
        <p class="small-note">
          Project assets are organized under:
          <br>
          <code>/assets/printing/Photos/</code> — pictures of finished parts and in-use shots<br>
          <code>/assets/printing/Files/</code> — project files, exports, or links to external hosts
        </p>

            <h3>Show Steer Trophy</h3>
            <p>
              A custom show steer trophy piece, modeled and printed as a display item.
              This print can be comissioned and to be printed based on the show steer.
            </p>

            <h3>Humidifier Vent</h3>
            <p>
              A custom vent adapter for a humidifier setup, designed to route airflow horozontially where it’s needed.
              The model is designed but still needs to be printed and photographed.

            <h3>100&nbsp;mm Coupler for Inline Air Vent</h3>
            <p>
              A 100&nbsp;mm coupler created to interface with an inline air vent, allowing flexible
              ducting or additional components to be attached securely.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">

            <h3>36&nbsp;mm to 32&nbsp;mm Vacuum–Sander Coupler</h3>
            <p>
              A reducer coupler that adapts a 36&nbsp;mm vacuum hose down to a 32&nbsp;mm handheld
              sander port. This helps with dust collection and makes mismatched tools actually work
              together.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">
              A straightforward but useful adapter that shows how 3D printing can bridge odd sizes.

            <p>
              A custom shift knob modeled for a 1990 Ford F350. This blends functional geometry with
              automotive aesthetics to refresh an older interior part.

  <h2>My Cults3D Portfolio</h2>
  <p>
    I publish some of my 3D models publicly on Cults3D, including functional parts, mounts,
    adapters, and a selection of game-ripped models that I’ve cleaned, repaired, and prepared
    for printing. This collection shows a broader range of the modeling and conversion work
    I’ve done beyond what’s featured on this site.

        <h2>Laser Cutting & Engraving (Planned)</h2>
        <p>
          This section will eventually include small laser-cut and engraved projects: labels,
          panels, simple brackets, and decorative pieces that complement the 3D-printed parts.
        </p>
        <p class="small-note">
          When those projects are ready, they’ll follow the same pattern as above, with photos
          in <code>/assets/printing/Photos/</code> and files or links referenced from
          <code>/assets/printing/Files/</code>.
